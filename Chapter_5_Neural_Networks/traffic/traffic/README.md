As research continues in the development of self-driving cars, one of the key challenges is allowing these cars to develop an understanding of their environment from digital images.

In our traffic-sign classification project, weâ€™re going to use TensorFlow and the German Traffic Sign Recognition Benchmark dataset to build a neural network that puts images of road signs into different classifications. 

Although I wrote the functions that loads the data into our program, resizes the images, and compiles the neural network, the main() function was provided by Brian Yu over at Harvard Univeristy.
